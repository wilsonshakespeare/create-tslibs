# create-tslibs

One stop TypeScript libraries and applications boilerplate generator

IMPORTANT: this script will automatically install `pnpm` and `np` globally
## Quick Start

Following are the boilerplate option that are available:

- [tslib](#tslib)
- express (coming soon)
- styled-theme (coming soon)

replace the option as above to following command:

```shell
npx create-tslibs --option=tslib --folder=your-lib-name

# --folder will be your application / library name
```

## PNPM

Instead of using npm, we will be using pnpm, publishing to npm for your packages will be using np, since np is not supported for pnpm hence publish.sh will ensure `pnpm i` run before `np` running

## tslib

This is a [TSDX](https://tsdx.io/) Extension setup is meant for developing __libraries (not apps!)__ that can be published to NPM. If youâ€™re looking to build a Node app, you could use `ts-node-dev`, plain `ts-node`, or simple `tsc`.

### Why this extension?

1. Inclusive of scripts to generate flow types

2. Inclusive of scripts to generate multiple modules

3. Setup for airbnb standard (and remove conflicting linting plugins)

## Development Platform:
This tool is designed for VS Code platform.

Hence I suggest using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as IDE:

The templates are already setup with vscode settings for auto format.

Ensure the following plugins are enabled:
- [ESlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) (This is setup with airbnb linting convention)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Add JSDoc Comment](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stevencl.addDocComments#)

Optional but Recommended:
- [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost)
- [Indenticator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sirtori.indenticator)
- [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=coenraads.bracket-pair-colorizer)
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

## Publishing to NPM

Recommend using [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np).

Important Note:
run `npm publish` for initial publish before running `np` commands
You may run into the following issue:

```shell
npm access 2fa-required create-tslibs
npm ERR! code E400
```

### Happy Coding
